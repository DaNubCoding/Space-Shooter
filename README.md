# Space-Shooter

A game I made 2 and a half years ago, when I first started Pygame. Code is not absolutely terrible but a lot of stuff are hardcoded and just not done in a great way. 
It was the first complete game with menus and stuff I've made so.. yeah, a large stepping stone. 
Back then I was incredibly proud of it, now that I look at it, it can be improved in so many aspects, but I'm still happy that I made this. 
Anyway, enjoy the bad code and the glitchy game :)
